> Develops new convergence criteria and computational methods for analyzing Lyapunov exponents of random matrix products under relaxed independence assumptions.

## Abstract

We study the ergodic properties of products of random matrices and their connections to Lyapunov exponents. Our main results establish new convergence criteria for the top Lyapunov exponent under relaxed independence conditions. We prove a general ergodic theorem for matrix cocycles over non-independent base dynamics and derive explicit bounds for the rate of convergence. These results have applications to the stability analysis of random dynamical systems and the spectral theory of random Schrödinger operators. We also present new techniques for computing Lyapunov exponents in concrete examples.

## Key Contributions
