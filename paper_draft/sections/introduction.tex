\section{Introduction}

The study of random matrix products has been a central topic in dynamical systems and ergodic theory since the foundational work of Furstenberg \cite{furstenberg1963} and Oseledets \cite{oseledets1968}. These products naturally arise in the study of random dynamical systems, where they describe the linearized behavior along trajectories.

The Lyapunov exponents associated with such products provide crucial information about stability and hyperbolicity. While the multiplicative ergodic theorem guarantees their existence under suitable conditions, computing or estimating these exponents remains a challenging problem in many concrete situations.

In this paper, we develop new techniques for analyzing the ergodic properties of random matrix products under relaxed independence assumptions. Our main results extend classical theorems in three directions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We establish convergence criteria for the top Lyapunov exponent under weak mixing conditions on the base dynamics
    \item We provide explicit error bounds for finite-time Lyapunov exponents
    \item We develop practical algorithms for numerical computation in concrete examples
\end{enumerate}

Our work builds on recent advances in the theory of random dynamical systems \cite{arnold1998} and non-commutative ergodic theory \cite{ruelle1982}. The applications we present include new results on the spectral properties of random Schrödinger operators and stability analysis of stochastic differential equations.
